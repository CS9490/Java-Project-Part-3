# Java-Project-Part-3
Showcasing Java skills in a project implementing JavaFX (third part). This project is the third part of a series of 4 projects showcasing my use of Java, all of which are connected and build off of each other.

This part of my JavaFX project built upon the previous two parts. The goal of this part was to add more classes and methods to the previous part of the program to create a program which made bounding rectangles for instances of an arc, a line, and a circle. Additionally, the program was to also draw the area of intersection between 2 rectangle objects, as well as the intersection of a rectangle object and a circle object. Images the program produced are provided in the documentation.
