# Java-Project-Part-3
Showcasing Java skills in a project implementing JavaFX (third part). This project is the third part of a series of 4 projects showcasing my use of Java, all of which are connected and build off of each other.

This part of my JavaFX project built upon the previous two parts. The goal of this part was to add more classes (such as MyPieChart), as well as build upon what was already created in the last 2 parts. Additionally, methods were also added to the program to create a program that would take in a text file (.txt), and give the user a GUI to choose the number of letters to represent on a piechart, which would give the frequency of letters within the .txt file as a decimal from 0 to 1. The file that was used to test the program was "War and Peace". Examples of the program running are in the documentation.
